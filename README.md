Hello! This is my mac_changer. You just need to run it
with sudo or when you root. It works in linux, you need
to have 'ifconfig' and python 3.7+

You can change your mac to custom, random or if you
run program but rethink, you can send q to quit.

Do not worry if your keyboard layout is Russian - my
program will do everything like you pressed q or r even
if you pressed Q/й/Й and R/к/К

Remember that first octet (**:00:00:00:00:00) must be
even (%2==0)
